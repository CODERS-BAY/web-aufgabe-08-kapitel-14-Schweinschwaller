                    I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum, but I
                    don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of
                    other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!
                    He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. I
                    have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.
                    <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up
                    with other websites.

                    Does everybody know that pig named <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig,
                    right? The concept of <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order
                    to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. He’s not a word hero. He’s a word hero because he was
                    captured. I like text that wasn’t captured. The other thing with <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum
                    is that you have to take out its family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. I know
                    words. I have the best words. <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum better hope that there are no
                    "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! You’re disgusting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you,
                    they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us.
                    They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume,
                    are good words. Does everybody know that pig named <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum? She's a
                    disgusting pig, right? Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if
                    they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.
                    <u><small>Lorem</small></u> Ipsum best not make any more threats to your website. It will be met
                    with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
